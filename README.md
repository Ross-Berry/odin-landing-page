# odin-landing-page

Second challenge of The Odin Project (Foundations Course), building a landing page using the skills learnt from the previous lessons on ["CSS Foundations"](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-css-foundations) and ["Flexbox"](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-flexbox). The design had to look similar to [Image One (Full Design)](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png) and take note of the colours and fonts used in [Image Two (Color and Fonts)](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png).
